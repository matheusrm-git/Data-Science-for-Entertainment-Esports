#  Demo Analyzer – Extracting insights from CS2 demos

## 📌 Overview
This project analyze cs2 match demos and extract information based on metadata collected from .dem files. I've created a module called demo_analyzer.py to transform metadata into heatmaps, kill and death charts, and player statistics. Additionally, using Streamlit library it's possible to create interactive dashboards. Teams could use those to study and create team-oriented strategies.
