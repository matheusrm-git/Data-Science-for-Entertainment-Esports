# 🎬🎮 Data Science for Entertainment Esports

Welcome to my project repository!  
Here you will find analyses, visualizations, and applications of **Data Science** focused on the **Film**, **Gaming**, and **Competitive E-sports** industries (e.g., *Counter-Strike 2*).  
I also include experiments with open datasets and projects that showcase my continuous learning journey.
